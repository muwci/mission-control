# Mission Control.

Meet *Misison Control*. *Mission Control* is a Flask web application that will help with transcript generation for the Mahindra United World College's Project
Based Diploma Program.

The prototype currently lives on the quick-and-dirty-solution `qds` branch. This will be merged to `master` after rigrous refactoring. Setup instuctions will be added then. 

*Mission Control* is written in Python 3. The required libraries can be `pip`-ed using the `requirements.txt` (TODO: Detailed set-up instructions).

More information about the Mahindra Project based Diploma can be found at
